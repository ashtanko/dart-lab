# Dart Lab Project

Welcome to the Dart Lab Project! This is a project designed to help you learn and practice Dart programming. It includes a series of exercises that cover various aspects of the language, from basic syntax to more advanced concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Dart Lab Project, you will need to have Dart installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Dart from the official website at https://dart.dev/get-dart.

Once you have Dart installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/ashtanko/dart-lab.git
```

## Structure of the Project

The Dart Lab Project is divided into several exercises, each of which is contained in its own directory. Each exercise directory contains a README file that explains the objective of the exercise, as well as a starter file that you can use as a starting point for your implementation.

## Contributing

If you notice any issues with the project or would like to contribute a new exercise, feel free to open an issue or pull request on GitHub. Your contributions are greatly appreciated!
